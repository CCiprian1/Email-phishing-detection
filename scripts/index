Here we have all the scripts used in our solution
The filenames and a short description it is presented below : 

* fine_tune_model.py - this is the script where we train the Llama model on the dataset
that we have downloaded from hugging face portal. At the end, the new model will be saved
on the local storage. 

* Bayes_classifiers_solution.py - this is the script where we test the Bayes classifiers.
This script is perfroming the tests on the dataset : "test_emails_big.csv"

* Llama_solution.py - this is the script where we test how the trained model of Llama,
obtained from the first script : "fine_tune_model.py" is performing in evaluating the
nature of an email : safe or phishing. This script runs on the dataset : "test.csv"

* Hybrid_solution.py - this is the script where we test our approach. We used the trained
model of Llama from the first script "fine_tune_model.py", we are applying our trigger patterns
and at the end we apply Bayes classifiers on the tokens obtained from Llama. This solution runs
on the dataset : "test_emails_big.csv".
